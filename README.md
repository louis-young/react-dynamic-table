# React Dynamic Table

A dynamic table with search and sort functionality.

![React Dynamic Table](documentation/react-dynamic-table.png)

## Description

A dynamic table that displays data fetched from an external service in a table with search and sort features.

The back-end acts as a proxy server that is responsible for making requests to an external API and formatting the response.

## Motivation

I built this application to practice using TypeScript in React and to build something new and learn a few things.

## Technologies

- TypeScript.
- React.
- Node.
- Express.
- Random User API.
