# React Table

A React application to fetch and display data in a table with search and sort features.

![React Table](documentation/react-table.png)

## Description

This is an application that fetches data from a server that formats data received from another service and then displays the data in a table with features to search and sort simultaneously.

## Motivation

I built this application to practice using TypeScript in React and to build something new and learn a few things.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
